# AirBnB_clone
# Description :label:

## 

HBNB is a complete web application, integrating database storage, HTML/CSS templating, API, front-end and others.

This team project is part of the ALX School Software Engineering program. </br>
It represents the first step towards building a full web application: the AirBnB clone.</br>
Data (python objects) generated are stored in a json file and can be accessed with the help of the json module in python. </br>

This first step consists of:
- a custom command-line interface for data management,
- and the base classes for the storage of this data.

# Command Interperter
# Description :label:

##

The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.</br>

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.</br>
